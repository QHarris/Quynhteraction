<h3>The Garden of Forking Paths</h3>
<pre> <a>
In 'The Garden of Forking Paths' I found the narrators voice to be interesting. He sets up the story and leads the readers into believing he isn't highly respected by his peers, being a chinese man in an english army. However, he speaks extremely eloquently and uses moer advanced vocabulary than an english armyman would use. This is explained as he used to be an english professor, but it's interesting to illustrate the contrast of being demeaned by peers despite most likely being more educated.

The actual infinite garden idea reminded me a lot of certain theories and tropes of the alternate universe. With each choice you could make there are infinite alternate universes which branch from that. Perhaps this book, being published in 1941, was ahead of its time. There have certainly been numerous alternate universe theories, but most have gained popularity recently.

I'm a bit confused closer to the end. How does Stephen Albert trust that the narrator is related to the creator of the garden. Another important point is why he killed Albert. I suppose that it was to covertly alert the Germans that the city is Albert, but then why must he have killed that specific Albert? If it was his mission to do so then is the only thing keeping from killing him immediately curiosity about his ancestor? 

On another note, I appreciate the narrator being well spoken and almost betraying our trust he built in the end. He had beautiful vivid imagery on the walk to Albert's house, and we view him as an underdog (of course, before the reveal that he's a german spy) because of his close encounters with Richard Madden and the implied demeaning of his character due to his race. The built trust and reveal of his crime and mission mirror that of the story, him being an undercover spy.
