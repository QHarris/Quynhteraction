        <h3>Alien Sex on The Beach.............$15 LND</h3>

        <div class=alien>
        <i>An entrancing mix of vodka, blue rasperry schnapps, orange juice, and a pinch of crater dust. Per the name, we filled a tub with the drink and let aliens have sex in it, giving it an outer-wordly organic taste.</i>
        </div>

        <h3>Cosmonaut Cosmopolitan.............$50 LND</h3>

        <div class= cosmo>
        <i>It's the classic Cosmo you know well from earth. Vodka, cranberry juice, lime, and triple sec. You pay for what you get. And what you're paying for, is a private session with a cosmonaut.</i>
        </div>

        <h3>Martian Martini....................$75 LND</h3>

        <div class= martian>
        <i>Please don't be fooled by the commonality of this drink -- our martini's are unlike anything you've tasted before, literally. Before you're served your drink you will be treated to a special experience  via a martian abduction that will regenerate your taste buds so it's as if you've never tasted anything before this drink. Truly, a once in a lifetime experience.</i>
